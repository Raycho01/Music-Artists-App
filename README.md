This is an iOS application, developed by using Swift and UIkit. Its purpose consists of browsing and exploring artists and songs. For the structure of the app I used the MVC design pattern. I also aimed to accomplish clean and well structured code, sticking to the S.O.L.I.D. principles and the best practices of OOP. For data I used Mock API - https://mockapi.io/
